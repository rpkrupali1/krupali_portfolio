        <p>
          I am mission-driven full stack developer and enterprise quality
          architect with a passion for learning new things, innovation at any
          time, collaboration and mentoring. I've always sought out opprtunities
          and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional
          path has taken many twists and turns - from manual testing to
          enterprise quality architect. I've never stopped engaging my passion
          to help others and solve problems. As a web developer and quality
          architect, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my
          unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic
          to make a difference. Below you can see my projects that I have worked
          in past or i've been working on lately.
