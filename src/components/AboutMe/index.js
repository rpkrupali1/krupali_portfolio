            I am mission-driven Software Engineer and Enterprise Quality
            Architect with a passion for learning new things, innovation,
            collaboration and implementation. Recently earned full stack web

          <p>
            I've always sought out opportunities and challenges that are
            meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken many
            twists and turns - from manual testing to full stack development.
            I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve
            problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a web developer and quality architect, I enjoy using my obsessive
            attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my
            solution-driven work ethic to make a difference.
